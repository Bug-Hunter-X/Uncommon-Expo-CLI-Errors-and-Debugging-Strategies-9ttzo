# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions to address them.

The errors are generally caused by issues like unusual project structures, dependency conflicts, incorrect configurations in `package.json`, `app.json`, or `expo.json` files, or incompatibility between the Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies.

The `expoBug.js` file contains examples of code that can trigger these errors, while `expoBugSolution.js` provides solutions and best practices to avoid them.  Detailed explanations are included in the comments of each file.
