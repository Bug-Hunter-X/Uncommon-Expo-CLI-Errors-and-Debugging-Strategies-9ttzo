This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual project structure or uses unconventional configurations. For example, if the project's `package.json` file is missing required dependencies or has incorrect configurations, or if the project's directory structure is not standard, Expo CLI might fail to recognize the project or might encounter unexpected behavior.

Another possible cause is an incompatibility between the Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies or Expo SDK version. If the CLI is outdated or the project uses an unsupported Expo SDK version, it can lead to various errors, including unexpected behavior.

Also, incorrect configuration in `app.json` or `expo.json` files can lead to errors. Such configuration issues might arise from typos or incorrect usage of Expo's APIs or options.

Finally, conflicts with other globally installed packages or environment variables can also interfere with Expo CLI's functionality causing unusual errors.
