To address these uncommon errors, developers must ensure they follow the Expo best practices and meticulously check their project configurations.

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and installed, with versions compatible with your Expo SDK. Pay special attention to dependencies related to Expo itself and any plugins or packages you are using.

2. **Check `app.json` and `expo.json`:**  Carefully review these configuration files. Look for typos or incorrect options, making sure all settings and values comply with Expo's documentation.

3. **Standard Project Structure:** Follow the standard Expo project structure to avoid confusion for the CLI.  Do not place project files in unexpected locations.

4. **Update Expo CLI:** Always keep your Expo CLI up to date to benefit from bug fixes and improved compatibility. Run `expo upgrade` to update to the latest version.

5. **Check for Conflicts:**  Conflicts with other globally installed packages are possible. Try creating a new project to rule out global package interference.

6. **Environment Variables:**  Incorrect environment variables can also cause problems.  Review any relevant environment variables and ensure they are set correctly.

7. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild of the project solves unexpected errors. Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

By systematically checking these points, most uncommon errors with the Expo CLI can be resolved.
